#kasper-one-page-psd-template (PSD to HTML/CSS Conversion)

After completing an HTML and CSS course, I worked on a personal training project  
where I converted a PSD file named "Kasper" into a fully responsive HTML and CSS webpage.
This project helped reinforce my skills in web development, focusing on layout structure, styling,
and ensuring the design's fidelity from the PSD to the final webpage.
